In this challenge, we were tasked to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug "Capomulin" against other treatment regimens for the pharmaceutical company Pymaceuticals, Inc. In the analysis, tumor volumes in mice were observed between those treated with Capomulin and other treatment regimens. Summary statistics and visuals were generated based on the data collected.

All files are stored in the folder "Pymaceuticals". The data used in the data analysis is housed in the folder "data", and the main code and final summary analysis are in the file "pymaceuticals_main".
